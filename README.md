# plain-news
First assignment in PHP

## Assignment instructions

The news feed will consist solely of a list of news feed items created by different authors. In total you should have 5 different authors all with at least 2 different news feed items each. The news feed item contents does not have to be logical data so you can use something like Lorem Ipsum to add some content.

### The news feed items should contain:

- Title
- Content
- Author
- Published date
- Like counter (the number of likes a news feed item has received)


### The news feed author items should contain the following data:

- ID
- Full name

Both the authors and the news feed items should be stored in arrays in a structure that's simple to use in your code and that's easily understandable. The authors and news feed items don't have to be within the same array but some sort of connection should exist between a news feed item and it's author. The news feed items should be ordered based on the published date, so the latest news feed item should go on top and vice versa.

### The project should use the following PHP functionality:

- Variables
- Multiple data types
- Arrays
- Functions
- Loops (for, while or foreach)
- Output (echo, print etc.)
