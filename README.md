## Code review
By Andreas Pandzic:
- You repeat your header code och foreach loop inside your article tags, in index.php, comics.php, podcast.php and movies.php.
- Try make one array by joining tables in your database query, instead of making two separate arrays for each table.
- You use inline styling in your img tags, this isn't consistent with your other css styling.
